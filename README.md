# purple
A simple project to determine what colors are "purple".

The data (currently stored in a .csv file) comes from my website, http://zoejtucker.com/purple.
Users are asked to determine whether a randomly determined color counts as purple.

The python code then runs a k-nearest neighbors algorithm on the data using a user-specified input color. 
Finally, the program determines whether the color is likely to be purple or not purple.
